# TODO

- switch the modal to headless ui (or any other library that provides accessbility out of the box)
- use the built in Next.js useLayout feature
- determine if I can dry up the classroom and classrooms pages (modal)

- check out trpc-openapi
- investigate https://github.com/streamich/react-use
- potentially remove react-daisyui and make own components (or checking chakra or mantine)
